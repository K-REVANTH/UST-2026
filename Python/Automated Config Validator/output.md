The config_validator.py script is a command line Python tool that validates configuration files in JSON, YAML, or INI format against a predefined schema. The schema defines required fields such as app_name, port, and database, along with their expected data types like string, integer, and boolean. When you run the script with a configuration file as an argument, it first checks whether the file exists.
Based on the file extension, it loads the content using the appropriate parser: json for JSON files, yaml.safe_load for YAML files, and configparser for INI files. After loading, the configuration data is converted into a dictionary and validated against the schema using the jsonschema validate function

If the structure and data types match the schema rules, the script prints VALIDATION SUCCESS and confirms the configuration is valid.
