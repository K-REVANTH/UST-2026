When I ran the script using python3 demo.py, it first checked whether the application process was running and then moved on to verify if the required port was properly bound. During the port check, it did not find any service listening on the expected port, so it displayed the message “Port not bound correctly.” After this, the script stopped executing because it is designed to terminate when a required condition fails. In simple terms, the script expected the application to be running and actively listening on a specific port, but since the port was not bound, it treated it as an error and exited intentionally.
